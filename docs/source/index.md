# Welcome to China!

```{note}
This project is under active development.

## Who We Are

We’re a team of passionate travellers who’ve studied in Europe and the US, and backpacked across continents. We know firsthand how daunting it can be to navigate a culture vastly different from your own. That’s why we built **ChinaTrip.Info**, to cut through the complexity and give you the *exact* knowledge you need to explore China smoothly, safely, and freely!

Currently, we're a small team of 4: Shangmin Guo, Yihua Chen, Jianle Zhu, and Ekaterina Petlichenko.
We're based in the UK and China at the moment.

## Our Mission

Our mission is simple: to make travelling in China easier, smoother, and more enjoyable for international travellers. Every tip, tutorial, and update here is:
 - 🔧 **Hands-on**: *actionable* steps, not just theory.
 - 🔄 **Reliable & Updated**: verified weekly (visa policies, VPNs, etc.).
 - 📚 **Comprehensive**: covering all aspects of travel in China.
 - 📥 **Offline Ready**: save any page as PDF instantly.
 - 🌍 **By travellers, for travellers!**

In the meantime, we’re also working on launching **video guides** on social platforms to make everything even clearer.
