# Welcome to China!

## Who We Are

We’re a team of passionate travelers who’ve studied in Europe and the US, and backpacked across continents. We know firsthand how daunting it can be to navigate a culture vastly different from your own. That’s why we built **ChinaTrip.Info** — to cut through the complexity and give you the *exact* knowledge you need to explore China smoothly, safely, and freely!

Currently, we're a small team of 3: Shangmin Guo, Yihua Chen, and Jianle Zhu.
We're based in the UK and China at the moment.

## Our Mission

Our mission is simple: to make traveling in China easier, smoother, and more enjoyable for international travellers. Every tip, tutorial, and update here is:
 - 🔧 **Hands-on** — *Actionable* steps, not just theory.
 - 🔄 **Reliable & Updated** — Verified weekly (visa policies, VPNs, etc.).
 - 📚 **Comprehensive** — Covering all aspects of travel in China.
 - 📥 **Offline Ready** — Save any page as PDF instantly.
 - 🌍 **By travellers, for travellers!**

In the meantime, we’re also working on launching **video guides** on social platforms to make everything even clearer.
